# Intersection of Two Arrays II
[See Problem on LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/intersection-of-two-arrays-ii/)

## Problem Description

Given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, return an array of their intersection. Each element in the result must appear as many times as it shows in both arrays, and you may return the result in any order.

### Approach:

- Sort both arrays.
- Use two pointers to iterate through both arrays.
- Compare elements at the pointers, and if they are equal, add the element to the result.
- If the elements are not equal, increment the pointer of the smaller element.
- Stop when any pointer reaches the end of its array.

## My Solution
> (EASY) **JAVA**

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] intersect(int[] nums1, int[] nums2) {
        int l1 = nums1.length;
        int l2 = nums2.length;
        int i = 0; 
        int j = 0; 
        int k = 0;
        Arrays.sort(nums1);
        Arrays.sort(nums2);
        while (i < l1 && j < l2){
            if (nums1[i] < nums2[j]) {
                i++;
            } else if (nums1[i] > nums2[j]) {
                j++;
            } else {
                nums1[k++] = nums1[i++];
                j++;
            }
        }
        return Arrays.copyOfRange(nums1, 0, k);
    }
}
```

### How I approached it:
#### Intuition:
1. **Sort the Arrays**: Start by sorting both input arrays to enable efficient comparison.
2. **Two-Pointer Technique**: Use two pointers to traverse the sorted arrays, comparing elements and collecting common ones.

#### Algorithm Explanation:
*How I really went about it:*       

1. **Initialization**:
   - Sort both input arrays `nums1` and `nums2`.
   - Initialize pointers `i` and `j` for traversing `nums1` and `nums2`, and a pointer `k` for the insertion position in the result.

2. **Intersection Process**:
   - Use a while loop to traverse both arrays until one pointer reaches the end.
   - Compare the elements at pointers `i` and `j`:
     - If `nums1[i]` is less than `nums2[j]`, increment `i`.
     - If `nums1[i]` is greater than `nums2[j]`, increment `j`.
     - If they are equal, add `nums1[i]` to the result and increment all pointers.
   - Continue this process until one of the arrays is fully traversed.

3. **Return**:
   - Use `Arrays.copyOfRange` to return the intersection result array up to the length `k`.

#### Example:
Consider example input arrays `nums1 = [1, 2, 2, 1]` and `nums2 = [2, 2]`. After sorting, `nums1 = [1, 1, 2, 2]` and `nums2 = [2, 2]`. The two-pointer approach will result in an intersection array `[2, 2]`.

#### Complexity Analysis:

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n log n + m log m)`
  - Sorting `nums1` and `nums2` takes `O(n log n)` and `O(m log m)` time respectively.
  - The two-pointer traversal takes `O(n + m)` time.
  - The overall time complexity is dominated by the sorting step.

- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`
  - The algorithm uses constant extra space.
  - Only a few extra pointers (`i`, `j`, `k`) are used for traversal and result insertion.

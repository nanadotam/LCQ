Great! Let's create your first GitHub repository program for the insertion sort list problem. We'll prepare the README.md file based on the provided information.

### README.md Template:

# Insertion Sort List

This repository contains a Java solution for sorting a singly linked list using the insertion sort algorithm.

## Problem Description

Given the head of a singly linked list, sort the list using insertion sort, and return the sorted list's head.

### Insertion Sort Algorithm:

- Insertion sort iterates, consuming one input element each repetition and growing a sorted output list.
- At each iteration, insertion sort removes one element from the input data, finds the location it belongs within the sorted list, and inserts it there.
- It repeats until no input elements remain.

## Examples

### Example 1:

**Input:**
```
head = [4,2,1,3]
```
**Output:**
```
[1,2,3,4]
```

### Example 2:

**Input:**
```
head = [-1,5,3,4,0]
```
**Output:**
```
[-1,0,3,4,5]
```

## Constraints

- The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 5000].
- Node values are in the range [-5000, 5000].

## Implementation

The Java solution for this problem is implemented in `Solution.java`. It includes the `insertionSortList` method which sorts the linked list using the insertion sort algorithm.

```java
// Example Java implementation
public class Solution {
    public ListNode insertionSortList(ListNode head) {
        // Your implementation here
    }
}
```

## Testing

To test the solution, you can use the provided examples or additional test cases.

### Next Steps:

1. **Create Repository**: Go to GitHub and create a new repository.
   
2. **Initialize with README**: Check the option to initialize the repository with a README.md file.
   
3. **Upload Code**: Add your Java implementation (`Solution.java`) for the insertion sort problem to the repository.
   
4. **Commit and Push**: Commit your changes and push them to GitHub using Git commands.

5. **Customization**: Feel free to customize the README further based on your preferences or additional information you'd like to include.

Once you've completed these steps, your GitHub repository for the insertion sort list problem will be set up with a detailed README explaining the problem, solution approach, and implementation.

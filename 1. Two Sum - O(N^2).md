# 1. Two Sum
[See Problem on LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)

## Problem Description

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return the indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

### Example 1:
Input: `nums = [2,7,11,15]`, `target = 9`  
Output: `[0,1]`  
Explanation: Because `nums[0] + nums[1] == 9`, we return `[0, 1]`.

### Example 2:
Input: `nums = [3,2,4]`, `target = 6`  
Output: `[1,2]`

### Example 3:
Input: `nums = [3,3]`, `target = 6`  
Output: `[0,1]`

### Constraints:
- `2 <= nums.length <= 10^4`
- `-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`
- `-10^9 <= target <= 10^9`
- Only one valid answer exists.

## My Solution
> (EASY) **Java**

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
        // iterate through the array
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            // iterate through the rest of the array to find the complement
            for (int j = i + 1; j < nums.length; j++) {
                if (nums[i] + nums[j] == target) {
                    return new int[] {i, j};
                }
            }
        }
        // return empty array if no solution exists
        return new int[]{};
    }
}
```

**Runtime:** 44 ms  
**Memory:** 45.25 MB  
**Time Complexity:** `O(n^2)`  
**Space Complexity:** `O(1)`

### How I approached it:
#### Intuition:
1. **Brute Force Approach**: Iterate through the array with two nested loops to find the two numbers that add up to the `target`.

2. **Check Each Pair**: For each element `i` in the array, check every element after it (`j`) to see if their sum equals the `target`.

#### Algorithm Explanation:       
*How I really went about it:*       

1. **Iteration**:
   - Start by iterating through the array `nums` from index `0` to `nums.length - 1`.

2. **Comparison**:
   - For each number at index `i`, iterate through the rest of the array starting at `i + 1`.
   - Check if the sum of `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` equals the `target`.

3. **Return**:
   - Return the indices `[i, j]` as soon as the pair is found that adds up to `target`.

#### Complexity Analysis:
- **Time Complexity**: `O(N^2)`
  - Two nested loops result in quadratic time complexity.
  
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`
  - No additional space is used, apart from a few variables.

#### Follow-Up:
A more efficient solution could use a HashMap to reduce the time complexity to `O(N)`.

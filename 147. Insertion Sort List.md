# 147. Insertion Sort List
[See Problem on LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/insertion-sort-list/description/)

## Problem Description

Given the head of a singly linked list, sort the list using insertion sort, and return the sorted list's head.

### Insertion Sort Algorithm:

- Insertion sort iterates, consuming one input element each repetition and growing a sorted output list.
- At each iteration, insertion sort removes one element from the input data, finds the location it belongs within the sorted list, and inserts it there.
- It repeats until no input elements remain.

## My Solution
> (MEDIUM) **JAVA**

```java
class Solution {
    public ListNode insertionSortList(ListNode head) {
        // check if the head node is null
        // and check if there's only 1 element in the list
        if (head == null || head.next == null) {
            // no need to sort
            return head;
        }
        
        // initialize dummy node with starting point 0
		ListNode dummy = new ListNode(0); // new starting of the sorted list
		ListNode current = head; // initialize the current node at head
		ListNode prev = dummy; // pointer to traverse through sorted list
		ListNode next = null; // next node to be sorted
		
        // checks till the end of the list
		while (current != null) {
			next = current.next; // make next the next node of the pointer
			
            while (prev.next != null && prev.next.val < current.val) {
				prev = prev.next; // prev pointer moves forward until prev.next is greater than current.val
			}

            current.next = prev.next; // Insert current node into the sorted list
            prev.next = current; // last element in new list points to current element
            prev = dummy; // resets pre and starts searching from the sorted list
            current = next; // Move current to the next node in the original list
		}
		return dummy.next; // Return the head of the sorted list 
    }
}

```

### How I approached it:
#### Intuition:
1. **Initialization**: Start with a dummy node (`dummy`) which acts as the starting point of the sorted list.

2. **Iterate through each element**: Traverse through each node (`current`) in the original linked list (`head`). For each node:

3. **Find the correct position**: Locate the proper position in the sorted list where the current node should be inserted to maintain sorted order.

4. **Insert the node**: Adjust pointers to insert the current node into the sorted list at the identified position.

#### Algorithm Explanation:       
*How I really went about it:*       

1. **Initialization**:
   - Create a `dummy` node initialized with a value of `0`, which serves as the head of the sorted list.
   - Initialize pointers (`current`, `prev`, `next`) to traverse through and manipulate the linked list.

2. **Sorting Process**:
   - Traverse through each node (`current`) in the original list (`head`).
   - Use `prev` to find the correct insertion position in the sorted list (`dummy`).
   - Adjust pointers to insert `current` into the sorted list.
   - Update pointers (`prev`, `current`, `next`) to continue iterating through the original list.

3. **Return**:
   - Return `dummy.next`, which points to the sorted list excluding the dummy node.

#### Example:
Consider an example input list `head = [4, 3, 5]`. Initially, we have an empty list (`dummy`). We iterate through each element:
- Insert `4` into `dummy` resulting in `[4]`.
- Insert `3` into `dummy` resulting in `[3, 4]`.
- Insert `5` into `dummy` resulting in `[3, 4, 5]`, which is the sorted list.

#### Complexity Analysis:

- **Time Complexity**: `O(N^2)`
  - We iterate through each node in the original list (`N` nodes).
  - For each node, in the worst case, we traverse the sorted list to find its correct position, resulting in `O(N)` operations per node.
  - Hence, the overall time complexity is `O(N^2)`.

- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`
  - The algorithm uses constant extra space regardless of the input size.
  - We only use a few extra pointers (`dummy`, `current`, `prev`, `next`) for traversal and manipulation, which do not scale with the input size.

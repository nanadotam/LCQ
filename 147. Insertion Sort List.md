# 147. Insertion Sort List
[See Problem on LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/insertion-sort-list/description/)

## Problem Description

Given the head of a singly linked list, sort the list using insertion sort, and return the sorted list's head.

### Insertion Sort Algorithm:

- Insertion sort iterates, consuming one input element each repetition and growing a sorted output list.
- At each iteration, insertion sort removes one element from the input data, finds the location it belongs within the sorted list, and inserts it there.
- It repeats until no input elements remain.

# 287. Find the Duplicate Number
[See Problem on LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-duplicate-number/description/)

## Problem Description

Given an array of integers `nums` containing `n + 1` integers where each integer is in the range `[1, n]` inclusive, find and return the duplicate number in the array.

### Problem Constraints:

- You must solve the problem without modifying the array `nums` and using only constant extra space.
- Only one duplicate number exists, but it may appear more than once.

## My Solution
> (MEDIUM) **JAVA**

```java
import java.util.HashSet;

class Solution {
    public int findDuplicate(int[] nums) {
        // Use a HashSet to store the numbers upon iteration
        HashSet<Integer> seen = new HashSet<>();

        // Iterate through the array
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            // Check if the number exists in the HashSet
            if (seen.contains(nums[i])) {
                return nums[i];
            }
            // Else add the number to the HashSet
            seen.add(nums[i]);
        }

        // Return statement to satisfy the compiler (though we expect this to never be reached)
        return -1;
    } 
}
```

**Runtime:** 19 ms    
**Memory:** 59.5 MB    
**Time Complexity:** `O(n)`    
**Space Complexity:** `O(n)`

### How I approached it:
#### Intuition:
1. **Using a HashSet for Detection**: The idea is to use a `HashSet` to track numbers we've encountered as we iterate through the array. Given the problem's constraints, we are guaranteed that one number repeats, so if a number appears twice during our iteration, it's the duplicate we're looking for.

#### Algorithm Explanation:       
*How I really went about it:*       

1. **Initialization**:
   - I used a `HashSet` named `seen` to keep track of the numbers as I iterate through the array.

2. **Iteration and Detection**:
   - As I iterated through the array, for each element:
     - I checked if it was already present in the `HashSet`. 
     - If it was, I returned it immediately as the duplicate.
     - If not, I added it to the `HashSet` and moved on to the next element.

3. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - Although the problem guarantees a duplicate, I added a `return -1;` at the end to ensure the method always returns an integer, which is necessary for the code to compile correctly.

#### Example:
Consider an example input `nums = [1, 3, 4, 2, 2]`. Initially, `seen` is empty. As we iterate through the array:
- Check `1`, add it to `seen`.
- Check `3`, add it to `seen`.
- Check `4`, add it to `seen`.
- Check `2`, add it to `seen`.
- Check the second `2`, which is already in `seen`, so we return `2`.

#### Complexity Analysis:

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`
  - We perform a single pass through the array (`n` elements), and each check or insertion operation on the `HashSet` takes `O(1)` time on average.

- **Space Complexity**: `O(n)`
  - The space complexity is `O(n)` due to the `HashSet` storing up to `n` elements in the worst case.

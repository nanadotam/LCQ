# Valid Anagram
[See Problem on LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-anagram/)

## Problem Description

Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` if `t` is an anagram of `s`, and `false` otherwise.

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, using all the original letters exactly once.

### Example 1:
Input: `s = "anagram"`, `t = "nagaram"`  
Output: `true`

### Example 2:
Input: `s = "rat"`, `t = "car"`  
Output: `false`

### Constraints:
- `1 <= s.length, t.length <= 5 * 10^4`
- `s` and `t` consist of lowercase English letters.

## My Solution
> (EASY) **Java**

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isAnagram(String s, String t) {
        // two strings 
        // t is an anagram of s
        // contains
        // if one of the letters isnt in at all we stop
        // all must be in

        // first check
        // if s.length == t.length 
        // immediately return false if not

        // check two
        // loop through 't'
        // the comparison****
        // lets start

        if (s.length() != t.length()) {
            return false;
        } 

        // frequency array fot lowercase characters
        int[] charCount = new int[26];

        // frequency counting approach
        for (int i = 0; i < t.length(); i++) {
            charCount[s.charAt(i) - 'a']++;   // increment count fot s
            charCount[t.charAt(i) - 'a']--;   // decrement count fot t
        }

        // check if all counts are zero
        for (int count : charCount) {
            if (count != 0) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```

### How I approached it:
#### Intuition:
1. **Frequency Count:** Since an anagram has the same characters with the same frequency, a simple frequency count for each character in the strings is sufficient to verify this.

2. **Efficient Frequency Comparison:** As we loop through both strings simultaneously, we increment and decrement the frequency of characters in a fixed-size array, which simplifies the comparison.

#### Algorithm Explanation:
*How I really went about it:*

1. **Length Check:** 
   - If the lengths of `s` and `t` are not the same, immediately return `false` since they can't be anagrams.

2. **Frequency Array:**
   - Initialize an array `charCount` of size 26 to track the frequency of each character (from `'a'` to `'z'`).

3. **Count Characters:**
   - Loop through each character in both `s` and `t`.
   - Increment the count for characters in `s`.
   - Decrement the count for characters in `t`.

4. **Final Check:**
   - After processing both strings, check if all counts in `charCount` are zero.
   - If any count is not zero, it means the strings do not have matching characters in the correct frequency.

#### Complexity Analysis:
- **Time Complexity**: `O(N)`
  - We traverse both strings once, where `N` is the length of the strings.
  
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`
  - The space is constant since the frequency array size is fixed at 26.

#### Performance:
- **Runtime**: 5 ms, faster than **53.03%** of submissions.
- **Memory Usage**: 42.91 MB, beating **80.60%** of submissions.

# 206. Reverse Linked List
[See Problem on LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/description/)

## Problem Description

Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the reversed list.

## My Solution
> **(EASY) JAVA**

```java
class Solution {
    public ListNode reverseList(ListNode head) {
        ListNode current = head; // pointer to traverse list
        ListNode previous = null; // initialize previous pointer to null 
        while (current != null) {
            ListNode next = current.next; // move forward on each iteration
            current.next = previous;
            previous = current;
            current = next;
        }
        head = previous;
        return head;
    }
}
```

**Memory:** 41 MB  
**Time Complexity:** `O(n)`  
**Space Complexity:**  `O(1)`

### How I approached it:
#### Intuition:
1. **Initialization**: Start by setting `current` to the head of the list and `previous` to null. The `next` variable is declared to keep track of the next node during traversal.

2. **Iterate through each element**: Traverse through the list, reversing the pointers at each step until reaching the end of the list.

3. **Finalization**: Once the end of the list is reached, update the head to point to the new first node (previously the last node).

#### Algorithm Explanation:       
*How I really went about it:*       

1. **Initialization**:
   - Set `current` to the head of the list.
   - Initialize `previous` to null and declare `next`.

2. **Reversal Process**:
   - Whilst the current node is not null:
   - Traverse through each node (`current`) in the list.
   - Save the next node using `next = current.next`.
   - Reverse the link by setting `current.next = previous`.
   - Move `previous` to `current`.
   - Move `current` to `next`.

3. **Return**:
   - Set `head` to `previous` which now points to the new first node.
   - Return the new head.

#### Example:
Consider an example input list `head = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`. The process is as follows:
- Initial list: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
- Step-by-step reversal: [2, 3, 4, 5], [3, 4, 5], [4, 5], [5]
- Final reversed list: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]

#### Complexity Analysis:

- **Time Complexity**: `O(N)`
  - We iterate through each node in the list exactly once.
  - Each iteration involves a constant amount of work (reversing the pointer), leading to linear time complexity.

- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`
  - The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space.
  - Only a few additional pointers (`current`, `previous`, `next`) are used, which do not scale with the input size.

# 1. Two Sum
[See Problem on LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)

## Problem Description

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return the indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

### Example 1:
Input: `nums = [2,7,11,15]`, `target = 9`  
Output: `[0,1]`  
Explanation: Because `nums[0] + nums[1] == 9`, we return `[0, 1]`.

### Example 2:
Input: `nums = [3,2,4]`, `target = 6`  
Output: `[1,2]`

### Example 3:
Input: `nums = [3,3]`, `target = 6`  
Output: `[0,1]`

### Constraints:
- `2 <= nums.length <= 10^4`
- `-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`
- `-10^9 <= target <= 10^9`
- Only one valid answer exists.

## My Solution
> (EASY) **Java**

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
        // initialize hashmap to track numbers and their indices
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();

        // iterate through the array
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            // compute complement = target - nums[i]
            int complement = target - nums[i];
            
            // check if complement exists in the map
            if (map.containsKey(complement)){
                return new int[] {map.get(complement), i};
            }
            // store the number and its index in the map
            map.put(nums[i], i);
        }
        // return empty list if no solution exists
        return new int[] {};
    }
}
```

### How I approached it:
#### Intuition:
1. **Efficient Lookup with Hash Map**: To optimize the brute-force approach, a hash map is used to store the numbers and their corresponding indices.

2. **One-Pass Solution**: As we iterate through the array, for each number, we compute its complement (i.e., `target - nums[i]`). If this complement already exists in the hash map, it means we've found the two numbers that add up to `target`.

#### Algorithm Explanation:
*How I really went about it:*       

1. **Hash Map Setup**:
   - Initialize a `HashMap` to store each number as the key and its index as the value.

2. **Check and Store**:
   - As you loop through the array, compute the complement (`target - nums[i]`).
   - Check if this complement already exists in the hash map.
   - If it does, return the indices of the current number and the complement.
   - If it doesn't, store the current number and its index in the hash map.

#### Complexity Analysis:
- **Time Complexity**: `O(N)`
  - We traverse the array once, performing constant-time lookups and insertions into the hash map.
  
- **Space Complexity**: `O(N)`
  - We store up to `N` elements in the hash map, where `N` is the size of the input array.

#### Performance:
- **Runtime**: 2 ms, faster than **98.45%** of submissions.
- **Memory Usage**: 45.08 MB, beating **19.53%** of submissions.

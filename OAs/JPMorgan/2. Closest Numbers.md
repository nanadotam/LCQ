# Closest Numbers
[See Problem on HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com)

## Problem Description

Given an array of distinct integers, determine the minimum absolute difference between any two elements. Print all pairs of elements that share this minimum difference in ascending order.

### Example 1:
Input:
```
4
4 -2 -1 3
```
Output:
```
-2 -1 
3 4
```
Explanation:  
The minimum absolute difference between any two elements in the array is `1`, and there are two such pairs: `(-2, -1)` and `(3, 4)`.

### Example 2:
Input:
```
6
6 2 4 10
```
Output:
```
2 4 
4 6
```
Explanation:  
The minimum absolute difference is `2`, and the pairs are `(2, 4)` and `(4, 6)`.

### Constraints:
- \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\)
- \(âˆ’10^9 \leq \text{numbers}[i] \leq 10^9\)

## My Solution
> **Difficulty Level:** Medium | **Language:** Java

```java
import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;
import java.util.stream.*;

class Result {

    /*
     * Complete the 'closestNumbers' function below.
     *
     * The function accepts INTEGER_ARRAY numbers as parameter.
     */

    public static void closestNumbers(List<Integer> numbers) {
        // Sort the numbers in ascending order
        Collections.sort(numbers);
        
        // Find the minimum difference
        int minDiff = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        for (int i = 1; i < numbers.size(); i++) {  // Start from 1 to avoid IndexOutOfBounds
            int diff = numbers.get(i) - numbers.get(i - 1);
            if (diff < minDiff) {
                minDiff = diff;  // Update minDiff to the smallest difference
            }
        }
        
        // Print all pairs with the minimum difference
        for (int i = 1; i < numbers.size(); i++) {
            int diff = numbers.get(i) - numbers.get(i - 1);
            if (diff == minDiff) {
                System.out.print(numbers.get(i - 1) + " " + numbers.get(i) + " ");
            }
        }
    }

}

public class Solution {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        BufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));

        int numbersCount = Integer.parseInt(bufferedReader.readLine().trim());

        List<Integer> numbers = IntStream.range(0, numbersCount).mapToObj(i -> {
            try {
                return bufferedReader.readLine().replaceAll("\\s+$", "");
            } catch (IOException ex) {
                throw new RuntimeException(ex);
            }
        })
            .map(String::trim)
            .map(Integer::parseInt)
            .collect(Collectors.toList());

        Result.closestNumbers(numbers);

        bufferedReader.close();
    }
}
```

**Runtime:** `O(n log n)` (due to sorting)  
**Memory:** Moderate  
**Time Complexity:** `O(n log n)`  
**Space Complexity:** `O(n)`  

### How I approached it:
#### Intuition:
1. **Sorting**: Sorting the array is necessary so that we can focus on consecutive elements for the minimum difference. This ensures that the smallest differences appear between adjacent elements.
2. **Single Pass for Minimum Difference**: After sorting, finding the minimum absolute difference between consecutive elements is straightforward in a single pass through the array.
3. **Output Formatting**: All pairs with the minimum difference are printed in ascending order, ensuring the correct output format.

#### Algorithm Explanation:
1. **Sorting**: We sort the array to make comparing consecutive elements easy.
2. **First Loop**: We calculate the minimum absolute difference by iterating through the sorted array and comparing adjacent elements.
3. **Second Loop**: Once we have the minimum difference, we go through the array again and print all pairs with this minimum difference.

#### Complexity Analysis:
- **Time Complexity**: `O(n log n)` due to the sorting operation.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(n)` for storing the array of numbers.

#### Performance:
- **Runtime**: Efficient for large inputs, handling up to `10^5` elements.
- **Memory Usage**: Moderate, depending on the input size. Uses list-based storage to handle inputs and comparisons effectively.

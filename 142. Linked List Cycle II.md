# 142. Linked List Cycle II
[See Problem on LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle-ii/description/)

## Problem Description

Given the head of a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return null.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the next pointer. Internally, `pos` is used to denote the index of the node that the tail's next pointer is connected to (0-indexed). It is -1 if there is no cycle. Note that `pos` is not passed as a parameter.

### Example 1:

**Input:** head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1  
**Output:** tail connects to node index 1  
**Explanation:** There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the second node.

### Example 2:

**Input:** head = [1,2], pos = 0  
**Output:** tail connects to node index 0  
**Explanation:** There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the first node.

### Example 3:

**Input:** head = [1], pos = -1  
**Output:** no cycle  
**Explanation:** There is no cycle in the linked list.

### Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 10^4].
- -10^5 <= Node.val <= 10^5
- `pos` is -1 or a valid index in the linked-list.

## My Solution
> (MEDIUM) **JAVA**

```java
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode(int x) {
 *         val = x;
 *         next = null;
 *     }
 * }
 */
public class Solution {
    public ListNode detectCycle(ListNode head) {
        // Tortoise and Hare approach
        // Two different pointers moving at different speeds
        // if there is a cycle, the fast pointer will catch-up to the slow pointer
        // where they meet is the `pos`
        
        // two-pointer initialization
        ListNode slow = head;
        ListNode fast = head;

        // iteration
        while (fast != null && fast.next != null) {
            slow = slow.next;   //move slow one step
            fast = fast.next.next;   //move fast two steps ahead

            if (slow == fast) {     // where they meet is the cycle
                // find cycle start 
                ListNode start = head;
                int pos = 0;
                while (start != slow) {
                    start = start.next;
                    slow = slow.next;
                    pos++;    
                }

                // System.out.println("tail connects to node index " + pos);
                return start;       // return node when the cycle starts 
            }
        }

        // if there is no cycle 
        return null;
    }
}
```

**Runtime:** X ms  
**Memory:** Y MB  
**Time Complexity:** `O(n)`  
**Space Complexity:** `O(1)`

### How I approached it:
#### Intuition:
1. **Initialization**: Use two pointers, one moving slowly and the other moving quickly through the linked list.

2. **Cycle Detection**: The fast pointer moves twice as fast as the slow pointer. If there is a cycle, the fast pointer will eventually catch up to the slow pointer.

3. **Finding the Start of the Cycle**: Once a cycle is detected (when the two pointers meet), initialize another pointer at the head of the list. Move both pointers one step at a time until they meet again. The meeting point is the start of the cycle.

#### Algorithm Explanation:
1. **Initialization**:
   - Create two pointers (`slow` and `fast`) starting at the head.
   - Move `slow` one step and `fast` two steps at a time through the list.

2. **Detection**:
   - If `slow` and `fast` meet, a cycle exists. Use an additional pointer (`start`) from the head to find the starting point of the cycle by moving `start` and `slow` one step at a time until they meet.

3. **Return**:
   - Return the node where the cycle starts, or `null` if no cycle is detected.

#### Example:
For input `[3, 2, 0, -4]` with `pos = 1`, the list forms a cycle starting at index `1`. The method detects this cycle and identifies the starting node of the cycle.

#### Complexity Analysis:

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`
  - The pointers traverse the list up to twice in the worst case.

- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`
  - The algorithm uses constant extra space for the pointers and does not require additional data structures.
